      From both sites, you can download it in binary (compiled) or source form.
    </para>
    <para>
      Right now I can only support RPM binary packages, because I do not have other systems to build binary packages on. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Types like Debian's &ldquo;deb&rdquo; package will need to contributed by someone else.

	Building cssed from source
      </title>
      <para>
	To install cssed from source you need to download the tarball package (named cssed-VERSION-BUILD.tar.gz).
      </para>
      <para>
	You need to uncompress it with the command:
      </para>

	</computeroutput>
      </para>
      <para>
	Once this has been done, move in to the created directory and
      </para>
      <para>
	type &quot;./configure&quot;,&quot;make&quot; and &quot;make install&quot; to install in your system the standard version of cssed.
      </para>

	</para>
	<para>
	  <emphasis>--with-debugging-output</emphasis> : This is for testers, it prints to standard out lots of debugging information. It decreases speed, so it's not recommended if you are not a tester.

	  Building from CVS
	</title>
	<para>
	  You can get the latest development version of cssed, following the instructions in the <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=95078">Source Forge's Project page</ulink>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Once you have got a working checkout of cssed from CVS, you can update it with the command:
	</para>
	<para>
	  <computeroutput>
	    &#36;cvs update
	  </computeroutput>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Take in account that each time new files are added some builds script can change. If your build script stop working after a CVS update, you can rebuild it with the two scripts found in the root folder of the cssed distribution:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      autogen.sh It uses a sort of brute force rebuilding every build script in the source tree.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      bootstrap It tries to rebuild only the needed files.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
	  To run it, just cd into the root cssed distribution folder and type:
	</para>
	<para>
	  <computeroutput>
	    &#36;./autogen.sh
	  </computeroutput>
	</para>
	<para>
	  or
	</para>
	<para>
	  <computeroutput>
	    &#36;./bootstrap
	  </computeroutput>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Both can work and to choose one of them is up to your preference.
	</para>
